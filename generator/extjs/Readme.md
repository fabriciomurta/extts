Copy over ExtJS files here.

The folder name must follow its original naming from the ext-commercial package
e.g. ext-6.2.1 for ExtJS 6.2.1.

This allows just specifying the ExtJS version and framework desired in the
../generate.cmd script.

Assuming version 6.2.1 of ExtJS, the script will look for files in paths as
follows:

- ExtJS classic: ext-6.2.1/classic/classic/src
- Core/common package: ext-6.2.1/packages/core/src
- ExtJS modern: ext-6.2.1/modern/modern/src
